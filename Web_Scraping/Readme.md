Working with XML and Sraping Web
================================

the following tasks should help to train the work with XML documents.

TASK 1
---------

Given is a well-formed and valid XML document (see file books.xml).  
Create an XML schema for this example. Add suitable data types and, if applicable, further restrictions (see https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_facets.asp).

TASK 2
---------

In the illustrations in the document Task Sheet-2_Annex.pdf a hierarchical structure is given, which should represent the structure of an XML document. The elements marked by letters represent the tags.  

1. create an XML document that represents this structure
2. describe the orange marked elements starting from the blue marked element using XPath expression (in Python).

TASK 3
---------

Create a Python script that is passed an element name of the books.xml from task 1 when called and that outputs the position of the element (path) within the tree structure.

TASK 4
---------

Determine all events of the TH Wildau in November 2020 (see https://www.th-wildau.de/hochschule/aktuelles/veranstaltungen/) using Python script. Save the data in a CSV file with the columns date, start, end and event title.  
To extract the data you can use the ElementTree XML API, the module html.parser or the tool BeautifulSoup.
